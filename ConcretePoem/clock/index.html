                I listen to the <span id="water">water</span> on nights I drink away<br>
                and the <span id="ghost">sadness</span> becomes so great<br>
                <br>
                I hear it in my clock<br>
                it becomes knobs upon my dressert<br>
                it becomes paper on the floor<br>
                it becomes a shoehorn a laundry ticket <br>
                it becomes cigarette <a href="../excerpt/" class="smoke">smoke</a><br>
